## What is Brown Climbing?
Brown Climbing is a community built around the love of all disciplines of climbing (bouldering, top rope, lead, and speed). Brown Climbing aims to provide recreational climbers with greater opportunities to travel to local gyms through shared transportation and aims to provide competitive climbers with an opportunity to compete on the USA Collegiate Climbing circuit through our competitive team. In addition, Brown Climbing will create a supportive space where members can improve their strength and technique in all disciplines. Finally, Brown Climbing aims to spread awareness of rock climbing on campus to new climbers and increase the overall accessibility of climbing to all Brown students.
